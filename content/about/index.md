# Hi, I’m Mahin

I’m a CS student who builds things, breaks things, and writes down what I learn so I don’t forget it later. This site is where I’ll keep short write-ups, project notes, and explanations that future-me (and maybe you) will find useful.

## Why this blog?
To document how I think through problems, share small wins, and learn in public. I also started a new internship and I need to log what I do there.
